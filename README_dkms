    DKMS support description

This file describes how to create a media-build DKMS package.

This branch of media_build contains the scripts for the media_build DKMS
support.
It requires a media-tree to be used by the resulting DKMS package. In principle
the DKMS support scripts can use any existing media-tree and use it. To get
reproducable results for distributions, we need a stable media-tree. Thus
there are branches available in 
   https://github.com/jasmin-j/dddvb-linux-kernel
Please ha a loog to README_dkms there for details about the naming scheme
of this branches.

First checkout the branch you want to create a DKMS from.

Then create the "linux-media.tar.bz2" archive out of the existing Kernel
tree. This can be easily done by:
   ./build_all.sh <kernelsourcedir> -dt
<kernelsourcedir> needs to point to your linux-media tree.


<FIXME>


The files "??_any_name.inc" are included by "build_all.sh" and can be used to
set/clear Kernel options and parameters. This is intended for distributions
which may add new files according to their needs.
